[2:34:20 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: hashedAppToken is a SHA256 hash of this value for Descent 1: 6n2E1ie161fJV3x
[2:34:29 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: and this value for Descent 2: t6y27SeRJ7ir525
[2:35:07 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: hashedMemberToken is a SHA256 hash value of what the user enters in the game (for authentication)
[2:35:18 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: there is a new field on member profiles on the website where they can enter the raw value
[2:35:28 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: it's called Rebirth Access Token
[2:36:39 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: this can help: http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator
[2:36:46 PM] To Meeting: SHA1 I assume?
[2:37:11 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: SHA256 is a successor to SHA1
[2:37:22 PM] To Meeting: ah
[2:37:29 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: it's a bit harder to break
[2:37:33 PM] To Meeting: derp
[2:37:33 PM] To Meeting: cool
[2:37:55 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: not as good as SHA512 but 512 hashes are too damn long
[2:38:07 PM] To Meeting: that how many bytes it is?
[2:39:11 PM] To Meeting: guess it doesnt matter
[2:39:20 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: I believe 256 is 32 and 512 is 64
[2:39:27 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: but yeah
[2:39:57 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: so with this schema: http://www.descentrangers.com/WebApi/DxxRebirth/v1/GameReport/Test
[2:40:07 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: you'd post that data to here:
[2:40:29 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: http://www.descentrangers.com/WebApi/DxxRebirth/v1/GameReport/ReportGame
[2:40:45 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: it will return the data you'll see if you click on that
[2:40:46 PM] To Meeting: change it to v01
[2:40:55 PM] To Meeting: to be consistant with how I already numbered it
[2:40:59 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: ok
[2:41:15 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: obviously don't post to production yet lol :) I'll setup my test server tonight
[2:41:19 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: and send the URLs
[2:41:29 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: also there is a really handy tool I want to give you
[2:41:34 PM] To Meeting: gonna start boosting myself brb
[2:41:54 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/
[2:42:15 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: this will let you submit the json data (POST) to the URLs to make sure your schemas are right, etc
[2:42:29 PM] To Meeting: good stuff, was wondering how I'd do that
[2:42:32 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: download: https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/downloads/detail?name=restclient-ui-3.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar&can=2&q=
[2:42:56 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: also
[2:43:09 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: a few things about the game report schema
[2:43:12 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: this guy: http://www.descentrangers.com/WebApi/DxxRebirth/v1/GameReport/Test
[2:43:27 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: GameTimeInMinutesForCooperative should obisouly be null for non-co-op games
[2:43:36 PM] To Meeting: yeah
[2:43:40 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: and that is also something the user should have to enter, don't take the # from the game
[2:43:52 PM] To Meeting: k
[2:43:54 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: since folks might save + load and resume over time,e tc
[2:44:11 PM] To Meeting: doesn't save and load use the same time it was saved at?
[2:44:13 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: placements: team placements = null for non-team game modes
[2:44:21 PM] To Meeting: oh, nm, i see what you're saying
[2:44:36 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: some guys track the time manually
[2:44:44 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: I use a stop watch
[2:44:56 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: since we take breaks once and awhike
[2:45:24 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: I need to give you the game mode IDs
[2:45:44 PM] To Meeting: how about I give them to you and you can change yours to what they are in the source and on the tracker?
[2:46:09 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: Anarchy = 1,
CaptureTheFlag = 2,
Cooperative = 3,
TeamAnarchy = 4,
RoboAnarchy = 5,
Entropy = 6,
Hoard = 7,
TeamHoard = 8,
HyperAnarchy = 9,
Monsterball = 10,
Bounty = 11
[2:46:21 PM] To Meeting: oh yeah, nm, it changes between games
[2:46:53 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: ExternalGameId: obviously that in-game ID we talked about
[2:47:14 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: it will uses that to prevent creating duplicate game reports
[2:47:26 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: if it finds ExternalGameId already, it will update the existing report
[2:47:43 PM] To Meeting: clever you
[2:47:55 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: HashedAppToken is the same as what I described for the authentication piece
[2:48:15 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: NumberOfTeams: null of not a team game mode
[2:48:23 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: oh
[2:48:34 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: and member placements can be anything, prefer 0 for cooperative
[2:48:45 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: they are auto set to 0 on my side
[2:48:53 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: that's it
[2:50:35 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: I'll start on changing v1 to v01 right now
[2:50:55 PM] To Meeting: k
[2:51:14 PM] To Meeting: scared to give me your cell number? :b

[3:26:06 PM] (Channel) VaiN: I do have parallels installed so I guess I could just run it through there
[3:26:19 PM] (Channel) VaiN: cool, I'll check it out one of these days
[3:26:29 PM] To Meeting: You need the original game content to play, that's just the binary
[3:26:31 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: bitbucket.org is free up to 5 users and has git support
[3:26:46 PM] To Meeting: I don't foresee us passing 5 devs any time soon
[3:26:56 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: yeah
[3:27:03 PM] (Channel) VaiN: Ya, still got my old files on my old PC
[3:27:05 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: got the Ranger site up there and just me and Sirius
[3:27:17 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: but we're using mercurial
[3:27:41 PM] To Meeting: yeah, I have no desire to learn mercurial right now
[3:27:51 PM] To Meeting: I hear it's better than svn, but that's not saying much
[3:27:59 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: mercurial is like git
[3:28:12 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: just dumbed down to make it easier to manage
[3:28:28 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: but I want to learn git so I have no preference

[3:32:22 PM] (Channel) Tylosaurus: xD
[3:33:12 PM] To Meeting: so we start at 1 when counting up, not 0?
[3:33:15 PM] To Meeting: 1 player means 1 player?
[3:33:48 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: placement?
[3:34:07 PM] To Meeting: game mode, placement
[3:34:09 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: placement starts at 1 i.e. 1st place
[3:34:11 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: oh
[3:34:11 PM] To Meeting: anything that uses an integer
[3:34:17 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: game mode starts at 1
[3:34:29 PM] Muted and deafened.
[3:34:38 PM] Tylosaurus moved to Building or Coding or Mapping.
[3:34:55 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: placement can be null or 0 for co-op
[3:35:23 PM] To Meeting: so 0 team placement if it's not team
[3:35:27 PM] To Meeting: 0 player placement if coop
[3:35:38 PM] To Meeting: everything, if not applicable to the gametype, set to 0
[3:35:44 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: null team placement if not team
[3:36:01 PM] To Meeting: but not 0?
[3:36:38 PM] To Meeting: need to look into that, see how json deals with null
[3:36:41 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: umm I'm not sure if I'm handling 0 values over here (force to null)
[3:37:04 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: I believe it's just "field":null
[3:37:07 PM] To Meeting: so null will work for every field it would apply to?
[3:37:13 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: yes
[3:38:07 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: so those would be GameTimeInMinutesForCooperative, NumberOfTeams, Placement and TeamPlacement

[4:04:35 PM] To Meeting: structs?

[4:05:07 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: http://www.json.org/
[4:05:16 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace).
[4:05:24 PM] To Meeting: k
[4:05:32 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: Each name is followed by : (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by , (comma).

[4:07:23 PM] (Channel) Verran@Work: simple is better
